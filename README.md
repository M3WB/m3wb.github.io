# m3wb.github.io
The sandbox for my webdev portfolio, hosted on github pages.
I am getting back into web dev after a long hiatus and working to elevate my game a bit, part of that is learning to operate with git.
The code here is literally all over the place since I am experimenting with a bunch of different things, new and old. 
The code will get cleaned up before pushing the site to a production environment. For the time being I am leaning to be ok with the mess.

Contact Form Note:
  + I am using Formspree to manage the contact form API. They seemed to have the right solution to fit my needs and abilities at the moment. (https://formspree.io)
  + There is no need to build the backend with PHP or Node.js but they have some copy and paste scripts that you can impliment and modify (which is what I am using)
